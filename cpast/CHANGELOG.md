# Changelog

## 0.6.0

Released on : Aug 29, 2024

Clex

Introducing custom character types in String, breaking syntax!

Now, for custom character sets use `@CH_ALL@`, `@CH_UPPER@` etc(as found in [Clex Language Specs](https://github.com/rootCircle/cpast/blob/7b999d957af246e03d9e7d258fab1fa4e21cb684/docs/clex/CLEX_LANG_SPECS.md)) or literal string like `'abc'` it will generate either of abc!

We also _dropped Character Type_ as it use was not profound! For using Character Type simply replace it with `S[1,]`

## 0.5.0

Released on : Aug 28, 2024

Critical Bug Fix:

- [Critical High] Due to race condition, `cpast test ...` might leave a
      orphan child process in non `--no-stop` cases! This will eventually
      eat all your system memory and potentially crash it as well! This
      commit fixes that as well!

Major Changes:

- improved error propagation, don't exit before erroring
- improved error types
- (breaking) modify public and private function signature to accommodate
      error propagation
- introduce CPAST_DEBUG env, to reduce verbosity of Success Testcase
      message! It's now disabled by default! To enable use `CPAST_DEBUG=1
      cpast test ...`

Released on : Jan 19, 2024 (Hotfix to 0.3.0)

- CLI

## 0.3.0

Released on : Jan 19, 2024

- CLI

  - `generate` now supports copying testcases over clipboard using `-c` flag, using which you can use testcases in other platforms as well

- Library Changes
  - Strong support for length based checks and charset(string modifiers). Sample usage `cpast generate "S[10,'U']"`
  - 'U' for uppercase, 'L' for lowercase, '0'..'9' for digit, 'N' for Alphanumeric, 'D' for All (including symbols), 'A' for alphabets only!
